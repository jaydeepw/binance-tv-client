**What this app is about?**
This is a simple app for Android TVs that reads the prices of crypto currencies from APIs provided
by different companies. In the beginning we will be using the API from Binance and
show prices in a list view.

## Inspiration
TVs are becoming more popular day by day. Now-a-days one can buy a 32" Android TV for $200.
I wanted to try my hands on development of apps specifically targetted to run on Android TVs.
This serves as inspiration for me developing this application.
